                         The ACME LUCK Protocol
                     draft-sheffer-acme-luck-latest

Abstract

   This document describes ACME LUCK (Limited Use of Cached Keys), a
   protocol that allows a domain owner to delegate some other entity
   (which we will call "the TLS server") the authority to terminate TLS
   connections on its behalf, using short-term certificates.  These
   certificates, whose validity is measured in days (e.g., 3 days),
   allow the domain owner to withdraw the TLS server's authorization
   when necessary, without requiring certificate revocation.  In order
   to attain a high degree of automation for the certificate generation
   and provisioning processes, this protocol extends the ACME
   interfaces.

1.  Introduction

   [Topalovic] [Liu]

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Use Cases

   TBD_NAME applies to cases in which a TLS Server terminates a TLS
   connection on behalf of the entity that "owns" the namespace under
   which the content is served.  A typical instantiation is a Content
   Provider which relies on one or more third party operated Content
   Delivery Networks (CDNs) to deliver content under its own name.

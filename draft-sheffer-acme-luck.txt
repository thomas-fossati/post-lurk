          The ACME LUCK (Limited Use of Cached Keys) Protocol
                     draft-sheffer-acme-luck-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes the ACME LUCK (Limited Use of Cached Keys)
   protocol.  LUCK allows a domain owner to delegate to some other
   entity (e.g., a CDN edge cache) the authority to terminate TLS
   connections on its behalf, using short-term certificates.  These
   certificates allow the domain owner to revoke the TLS server's
   authorization when necessary, without requiring certificate
   revocation.

1.  Introduction

   Content owners frequently prefer a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to
   distribute their content.  CDNs typically have very large footprint,
   which allows them to serve content to a global audience with a high
   aggregate bandwidth and low latency.  To protect this traffic, the
   CDN uses HTTPS and presents a certificate that usually bears the
   content owner's name.  However, many content owners balk at sharing
   their long-term private keys with another organization.

   This memo describes the ACME LUCK (Limited Use of Cached Keys)
   protocol.  LUCK extends ACME [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] to automate the
   generation and renewal of short-term certificates that a third party
   server (e.g., a CDN edge cache), which has been explicitly authorized
   by the legit content owner, can use to serve content using that
   content owner's domain name.

   The content owner can revoke the third party's authorization when
   necessary by instructing the ACME server to stop the automatic
   certificate refresh and let the active certificate expire (e.g.,
   after a few hours).  Note that, by enforcing the use of short-term
   certificates, LUCK doesn't rely on explicit certificate revocation in
   order to work (see section 3.2.1 of [I-D.iab-web-pki-problems]).

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used to identify the LUCK protocol actors:

   o  Content Owner: the owner of a domain name that uses a third party
      to deliver its content via HTTPS.

   o  TLS server: the node delegated by the Content Owner to terminate
      the TLS connection (typically a CDN edge cache).  During TLS
      handshake it offers its clients a certificate bearing the Content
      Owner's name.

   o  ACME LUCK Server: an ACME server that also exposes LUCK interfaces
      to the Content Owner to boostrap and terminate the delegation, and
      to the TLS server to serve the automatically refreshed
      certificates.
